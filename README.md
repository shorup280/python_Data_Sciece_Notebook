## Overview

This repository contains my complete learning journey through the **Python for Data Science** tutorial series. I followed along with the tutorial and practiced coding simultaneously, ensuring a hands-on learning experience. To make it easier for both beginners and experienced learners, I have meticulously commented on every line of code in my notebook.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Codebase**: Covers fundamental Python concepts relevant to data science.
- **Well-Documented**: Each line of code is commented for better understanding.
- **Practical Use of Libraries**: Implements popular data science libraries such as:
  - `numpy` (for numerical operations)
  - `pandas` (for data manipulation)
  - `matplotlib` (for data visualization)
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Suitable for anyone starting with Python in data science.
